The problem was likely due to the asynchronous nature of `getInitialURL`.  The method doesn't immediately return the URL; instead, it needs time to resolve. The solution is to add a delay and handle possible failures more gracefully.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getDeepLink = async () => {
      let url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
      if (url == null) {
        // Wait for a short time before retrying
        setTimeout(async () => {
          url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
          setInitialUrl(url);
        }, 500);
      } else {
        setInitialUrl(url);
      }
    };
    getDeepLink();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {initialUrl ? <Text>{initialUrl}</Text> : <Text>No deep link found</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}
export default App;
```
This enhanced code includes a timeout to allow for asynchronous resolution and handles the `null` scenario more effectively.
